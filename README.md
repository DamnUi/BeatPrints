## üí° Inspiration & Gratitude

I stumbled upon incredible music posters on Pinterest and was amazed by their uniqueness. Not finding a platform to create similar posters with appealing designs, I went out to develop a program that simplifies the process with just a few clicks and inputs. Surprisingly, the result exceeded my expectations.
